          <h2>Trying to meet you for the 1st time</h2>
          <p>
            I was so excited to meet you! I wish the phone incident hadn't happened. But you know, that still wasn't the highlight of the day. You waited for me, and I just couldn't do anything about it, but you were the one who made me feel better.

          <h2>When we actually meet for the 1st time</h2>
          <p>
            You have no clue how important it was to meet you the day I came to meet you outside your office. It was the first time I met you!!! I was so excited and was feeling nauseous all the time because I was so nervous about meeting you. Yes, it's not just you who has cold feet. :P
            I came knowing full well that we would not be able to meet for long, but I was really sad that I did not meet for longer... You have no clue how sad I was not talking to you for a month after that...

          <p>
            I was looking forward to meeting you the whole time we started talking again, but another plan didn't pan out, and I was so sad... I did enjoy myself with my fam, but it was just not right that we couldn't meet that day.

It was as awesome as I thought it would be cz you were awesome... It was all about you... You were funny, cute, and witty, and honestly, that's what I was expecting... Also, noo one recommends me drinks and food, but you did, and it was awesomee!! You got me addicted to Punjabi music again.. Mr Crust was tremendous and just holding your hand while driving IDK why just gave me goosebumps... Alsoooo.... I DID NOT WANNA GO BACK HOMEEE!! I just wanted to be with you for the duration I could stay... IDK how long that is.. I have so much to say, but I will leave you with just this one thing, I absolutely love spending time with you and talking to you, and I hope you feel the same way cz I will make sure we meet more often...
